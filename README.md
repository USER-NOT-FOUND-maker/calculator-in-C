# calculator-in-C

Just a very simple calculator in C

supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

is susceptible to overflow errors but works if you are not creating overflow errors

this is my very first C project, so yes it is ugly, yes it is stupid, yes it is simple but looks grossly overcomplicated because of how bad i am at C. Yes this couldve been done quicker, yes this couldve been done better, yes this couldve been done easier, yes the formatting is horrible, yes the code couldve been done better.

yes this program made me hate C. yes coding this took an hour. Yes i had to use ai to find out about the stdbool.h library. Yes i had to use ai to realise that i couldnt use the "in" operator the same way I could in python.

yes this couldve been done in cpp, yes this couldve been done in python, yes this couldve been done in JavaScript.

but it isnt. And thats because this is my FIRST PROJECT IN C.

I think it is important as developers to realise that often times when people learn a new language or when people start programming that it can be very difficult for them. what wouldve taken 3 minutes in python (which those 3 minutes would have just been typing) took me an hour in C. But I think its a good thing that i struggled with such a simple looking program, it shows how complex programming could truly be. Building this made me appreciate the simplicity of python and it made me appreciate that I use python more than C. But I want to re-iterate that as a community, the programming world needs to learn when to stop bugging everybody about everything bad they did with their code, yes my code is ugly, yes my code is lacking in features, yes the output isnt formatted well. This is a learning opportunity though, this isnt software that I am giving out to the public

So critic my code, say it is ugly, say it is bad, suggest fixes, but dont be a dickhead, dont feel the need to flex your intelligence over others, dont feel the need to flex your fluency in a language to others. It is highly discouraging to new developers when they see others mock them for their skills.

Anyway, have fun with this code.
